# Skeleton Directory. It will have your project layout, automated tests, modules, and install script.
# Before you start, install the following Python pacakages:
# 1. pip from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip
# 2. distribute from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute
# 3. nose from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/nose
# 4. virtualenv from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv
# Sometimes the Python installer does not add the C:\Python27\Script to the system PATH.
# In that case, add it to the path just like C:\Python27
# Make sure you read the documentation for distutils at http://docs.python.org/distutils/setupscript.html
